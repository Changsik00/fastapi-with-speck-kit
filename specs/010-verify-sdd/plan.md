# Plan: Verify SDD & Update Documentation

## Goal
Verify the "Strict SDD" workflow by manually executing it and ensuring the project's root documentation aligns with the new `agent.md` rules.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plan involves modifying `README.md` to explicitly mention `agent.md` and `constitution.md`. This is a public-facing change.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation Layer
#### [MODIFY] [README.md](file:///Users/ck/Project/Changsik/fastapi/README.md)
- **Add "Contributing" Section**: Explicitly link to `agent.md` and `constitution.md`.
- **Add "AI Agent" Section**: Brief instruction on how to use AI with this project (e.g., "Just drop `agent.md` and relax").

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. **Self-Check**: Verify that `README.md` has working links to the rule files.
2. **Process Verification**: Confirm that this very plan was created, reviewed, and approved before execution (Self-fulfilling prophecy).
